<li>Being really thirsty.</li>
<li>Feeling sick or more tired than usual.</li>

2,en,"What should my blood sugar be when I wake up, before and after meals? ","Fasting or before-meals blood glucose (or blood sugar) goal of 70–130 mg/dl. <br/>
One to two hours after eating at or under 180 mg/dl is recommended."
3,en,Will insulin make me gain weight?,"The reason we need insulin is to push glucose into cells for energy. For this reason, it can—but doesn’t have to—cause weight gain. To prevent weight gain: 
<ul>
<li>Practice portion control. </li>
<li>Burn extra calories with exercise. </li>
<li>If you experience hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), treat it with just 15 grams of carb.</li>
</ul>"
4,en,What if my legs hurt when I start walking?,"You have signs of peripheral arterial disease. The pain may occur while you walk because muscles need increased blood flow and stops when you sit because your muscles then require less blood flow. PAD increases the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and foot ulcers. "
5,en,Can I drink alcohol?,"Yes, adults with diabetes can drink alcohol and should follow the same guidelines as the general public—an average of up to one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men, with no more than three or four drinks in any single day for women and men, respectively. Alcohol is the only nutrient that doesn’t require insulin to be broken down for energy; carbohydrate, protein, and fat do. However, drinking more than three drinks per day over time has been shown to make glucose control a challenge.<br/>
For people who take insulin or another blood glucose-lowering medication that can cause hypoglycemia, eat some food when drinking alcohol. A Significant alcohol intake can cause hypoglycemia a number of hours later, so regularly check blood sugar levels when you drink."
6,en,What if I have my menstrual cycle or go through menopause?,"It’s common for women to have hormone fluctuations the week before their period, and those can affect glucose control. Women become in this period more sensitive to insulin causing hypoglycemia. 
During perimenopause, hormons fluctuate and that leads to glucose swings. An early sign of perimenopause for women who take insulin is hypoglycemia due to dropping progesterone."
7,en,What to eat before and after exercising?,"Foods that contain carbohydrate are quick and easy to digest for energy. Eat foods like bread, crackers, pretzels, dry cereal, 100 percent fruit juice, or sports drink with calories. But if weight loss is a goal and you aren’t at risk of hypoglycemia, just drink water. Unless your workout was particularly exhausting or lasted several hours, you don’t need food. <br/>
People who take insulin and are physically active should consult their health care provider about how to adjust insulin dosages."
